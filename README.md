WavesDaos is bringing off-chain voting to the Waves DAO ecosystem by building with the design patterns used by popular DAO systems such as snapshots and Tally.

This is made possible by using the Waves signer library for verifying/authenticating wallets off-chain, Waves Node REST API to get user voting power a proposal creation block height, and finally IPFS as decentralized storage.

WaveDOAs will also be providing API access and APK for platforms to be able to display proposals and voting details from their Dapps. They will also be able to programmatically manage space and proposal settings.
